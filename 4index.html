    <div class="explanation">
        <p>What happens if you provide your email address and phone number at all times and everywhere? Tons of spam in your Inbox and hundreds of automated calls in incoming calls, that's what. Even if you need to leave contact information for online services and online stores, at least you should not provide them to random people on social networks. It is even better to create a separate "unwanted" mailbox that will not be sorry to delete. Ideally, it would be nice to have a separate phone number for such cases.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="help_stuff">
        <li> Register an additional email address and buy an additional SIM card to register in online stores. Use them in other situations where you are required to leave your data to strangers. </li>
