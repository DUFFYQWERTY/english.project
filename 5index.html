        <h1><b>5. Use messengers with end-to-end encryption</b></h1>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation">
        <p>Most modern messengers use encryption. However, in many of them, messages are encrypted only during transmission to the server and are already stored there in unencrypted form. What happens if someone hacks such a server? Even if this risk is not too great, it is best to avoid it completely. To do this, use Messenger with end-to-end encryption. In such applications, even their creators can't read your conversations, since only you and your interlocutor have the keys to the cipher.</p>
