    <div class="explanation" style="height: 300px">
        <p>Mobile apps often ask for access to contacts or files on the device so they can use the camera, microphone, geolocation, and so on. Some applications really need this to work properly. But not all: many people use the information they receive to oversee marketing (or even worse). Fortunately, app permissions are fairly easy to control. The same goes for browser extensions, which, unfortunately, are also known to be prone to spyware.</p>
