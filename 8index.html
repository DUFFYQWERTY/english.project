    <div class="explanation">
        <p>The password to unlock your computer doesn't have to be terribly complicated: you don't protect yourself from hackers or idle curiosity. Smartphones are often lost and sometimes stolen, so it's best to be careful and use a six-digit (or even more) PIN code instead of the four provided by the default operating system. The fingerprint scanner and facial recognition are also good. But remember, biometric technologies also have their limitations.</p>
